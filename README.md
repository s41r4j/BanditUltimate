## Hello_User!

> *The project **' Bandit Ultimate '** is made with a understandable intention , which most or probably everyone faces while playing this wargame !!*

### Last time, when you were playing [Over The Wire](https://overthewire.org/)'s [Bandit Wargame](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) , for some reason you have to leave in the middle of the game at a specific level. When , next time you try to continue you need the last level's password , which you were in !! So we have to do a google search everytime OR have to save the previous pass.

### To simplify this task here is the CLI based program : *Bandit Ultimate*

Bandit Ultimate is a tool made in python that allows you to login into any level (For the sake of fair play , the level you were in last time)
