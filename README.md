## Hello_User!

<br>

> *The project  **' Bandit Ultimate '**  is made with a understandable intention , which probably everyone faces while playing this wargame !!*

### Last time when you were playing [Over The Wire](https://overthewire.org/)'s [Bandit Wargame](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) , for some reason you have to leave in the middle of the game at a specific level. When next time you try to continue you need the last level's password , which you were in !! So we have to do a google search everytime OR have to save the previous pass.

### To simplify this task here is the CLI based program : [*Bandit Ultimate*](https://github.com/s41r4j/BanditUltimate)

#### > Bandit Ultimate is a tool made in [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) that allows you to login into any level of [Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) with the help of this tool .

<br>

<details>
<summary>Do Fair Play Buddy , Dont Cheat !! </summary>
<br>
Note : Bandit Ultimate is made with intention to login in the bandit level you left .
This makes the login process easy , saving time . Now invest this time in learning and solving the bandit levels - increasing your skills !!
